    "## Background & Introduction to Formula 1 Racing\n",
    "Formula 1 racing combines high-speed competition with complex engineering, where predictive analytics play a crucial role in decision-making. Teams utilize vast amounts of data, from tire degradation to driver performance, to optimize race strategies and improve outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior Work\n",
    "1. **Application of Machine Learning**: Recent studies, such as the one documented by Aalto University, have explored the use of machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to predict the timing of pit stops in F1 races. This research highlights the importance of various race factors, including tire degradation and weather conditions, in decision-making processes. ([Aaltodoc](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/70d5a580-c282-4278-8462-94d061471546/content))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comprehensive Data Analysis Platforms**: Platforms like the one found in the GitHub repository 'f1-analysis' use the FastF1 library to manipulate telemetry and race data for in-depth insights into race performance and strategies. This repository serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts and analysts looking to perform statistical analyses and create data visualizations based on F1 race data. ([f1-analysis](https://github.com/lalutir/f1-analysis))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Industrial Impact of Predictive Analytics**: An overview provided by sites like Penn State's page on predictive analytics in F1 discusses the industrial relevance and financial impact of predictive analytics in the sport. It outlines how teams leverage real-time data from over 300 sensors on each car to make strategic decisions that can alter race results, illustrating the blend of data science with competitive sports to enhance team performance and race strategy.

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We predict that track characteristics, driver performance metrics, and weather conditions will each have a significant influence on the probability of winning a Formula 1 race. These factors are hypothesized to interact, such that their combined impact is more predictive of race outcomes than any single factor alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is based on the understanding that Formula 1 racing is a complex sport where various elements such as the physical layout of the track, the skills and current form of the driver, and unpredictable elements like weather dramatically affect performance. Previous studies and data analyses, such as those referenced in existing research on machine learning applications in F1 (e.g., the study at Aalto University), suggest that these variables not only affect race strategy but also directly influence race results through their impact on vehicle handling, tire wear, and driver safety. The interaction of these variables is likely complex, given the dynamic and highly conditional nature of racing, where the optimal strategy must continuously adapt to the evolving race conditions.

    "We expect everyone in our team to communicate effectively on our text message group.  Our expectations are replies within 2 days on most days and faster replies as we come closer to deadlines. We have decided to have open communication and say everything they feel related to the project and other team members bluntly but politely. If any of us see that someone isn't voicing their opinions because they might be shy, we will try our best to motivate them to speak up. We would prefer the decisions to be unanimous and we will try our best to accommodate if any team members disagrees with the others. If this doesn't work out, we will go with the majority vote because we believe everyone in our group is mature enough to handle disagreements. If a team member is not responding on time and the deadline is extremely close, we will decide to go with a majority vote then too. We have set a schedule with deadlines as proposed below. If someone is struggling with a deliverable, we will try our best to help them and can give them an easier task for that deliverable. They can in return contribute more when something else is due. We are going to publish a list of tasks on a google spreadsheet and update them after each checkpoint from our project timeline. People can tick them off when they are done and we hope to have everything completed before the deadline. We will assign tasks to everyone during our meetings. "
