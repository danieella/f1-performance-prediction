# Formula 1 Performance Prediction

This project explored how driver performance and race conditions influence race outcomes using historical Formula 1 data. Our goal was to identify key factors affecting performance and build predictive models to estimate race results under varying conditions.
We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets including driver statistics, weather conditions, and pit stop performance.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

**My Contributions:**
- Collaborated with teammates during project work sessions to develop data visualizations analyzing driver performance trends.
- Refined the research hypothesis and project to align with predictive modeling objectives
- Developed project presentation video to translate technical findings

**Results:**
The project identified several performance indicators that strongly correlate with race outcomes, including pit stop efficiency and environmental conditions. Our models demonstrated the potential of machine learning approaches for sports performance analytics.
